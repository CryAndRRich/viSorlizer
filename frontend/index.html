            Sorting Algorithms
        </h2>
        <div class="description-content" data-aos="fade-right">
            <p>Sorting algorithms are used to put elements of a list into an order, such as numerical order or lexicographical order<br><br>
            This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science.
            For a long time, new methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster<br><br>
            There are currently hundreds of different sorting algorithms, each with its own specific characteristics.
            They are classified according to two metrics: space complexity and time complexity<br><br>
            Those two kinds of complexity are represented with <a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/asymptotic-notations#:~:text=Asymptotic%20notations%20are%20the%20mathematical,linear%20i.e.%20the%20best%20case." target="_blank">asymptotic notations</a>, mainly with the symbols O, <span class="symbol">Θ</span>, <span class="symbol">Ω</span>, representing
            respectively the upper bound, the tight bound, and the lower bound of the algorithm's complexity, specifying in brackets an expression in terms of
            <code><var>n</var></code>, the number of the elements of the data structure<br><br>
            Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused.
            We believe visualizing sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!
