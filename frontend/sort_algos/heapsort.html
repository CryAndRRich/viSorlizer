<p data-aos="fade-right">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort">Heap sort</a>is an efficient, comparison-based sorting 
algorithm that reorganizes an input array into a heap and then repeatedly removes the largest node from 
that heap, placing it at the end of the array. The heap sort algorithm can be divided into two phases: 
heap construction, and heap extraction<br><br>In the first phase, a heap is built out of the data<br><br>
In the second phase, the heap is converted to a sorted array by repeatedly removing the largest element 
from the heap, and placing it at the end of the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain 
the heap property. Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the result is a sorted array
