<p data-aos="fade-right">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble sort</a>, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple 
sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the 
one after it, swapping their values if needed <br><br>These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to 
be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted
