<p data-aos="fade-right">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand_sort">Strand sort</a> is a recursive sorting algorithm 
that sorts items of a list into increasing order<br><br>The algorithm first moves the first element of a list into 
a sub-list. It then compares the last element in the sub-list to each subsequent element in the original list.
Once there is an element that is greater than the last element in the sub-list, the element is added to the sub-list. 
Once all remaining elements are compared, the sub-list is merged into a new list. Repeat this process and merge all 
sub-lists until all elements are sorted
